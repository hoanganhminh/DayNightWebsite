# DayNightDummyWebsite
This is a dummy website I created over a year ago when I first embarked on my journey to learn JavaScript for interacting with DOM elements. It also marked my initial experimentation with SCSS. Take a moment to visit the website and see how I've transformed day into night â€“ you'll find it quite intriguing!
